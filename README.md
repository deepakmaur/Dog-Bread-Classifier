### Dog Breed Identification Project

#### The Challenge
This project's objective was to create a model capable of classifying dog breeds from images. The challenge involved identifying 120 different breeds with a limited number of training images per class, adding complexity to the task.

#### Approach
To tackle this image recognition task, I employed transfer learning with Resnet18. Transfer learning allowed me to leverage a pre-trained model, providing a head start and mitigating the issues caused by the small training dataset. Resnet18's architecture, known for its depth and ability to handle the vanishing gradient problem, was well-suited for this task. Although deeper models like Resnet34 could potentially yield higher accuracy, the computational resources I had at my disposal justified the choice of Resnet18. Its use of residual blocks ensured that each training example contributed significantly to optimizing the model.

#### Performance
The model achieved approximately 70% accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating reasonable performance given the constraints. Here are a few examples of the predictions:

#### Future Enhancements
To further enhance the model's accuracy, two primary strategies can be considered: using a deeper model or expanding the training dataset. A deeper model could address underfitting, while a larger dataset, perhaps from sources like the Stanford Dogs Dataset, could reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. Additionally, conducting an error analysis and generating a confusion matrix would provide insights into misclassifications, potentially revealing if similar-looking breeds are causing errors.
